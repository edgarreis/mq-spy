Welcome to the mq-spy source code repository!

For more information on the available functionality, see the project's wiki at https://github.com/kamilfb/mq-spy/wiki (currently under construction).

The branching model (not fully in place yet) is as follows*:

  * master branch - where all the official releases live; tag for each release
  * development branch - where all the work is actually taking place
  * feature and release branches - used when required; for experimenting with new features and for major releases respectively

\* - this has been heavily influenced by http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.
